# Modal Window Project

Again, just using the readme for notes

- querySelectorAll will get ALL items of a particular class and put them in an array in order
- Ah, ok, this seems liek the first real use for 'const functionname = function(){foo}', because then you can just call functionname when it comes up.
- Made my own life harder with this one by adding multiple modals but still tryign tohandle it all as arrays rather than just building each modal. Code is a little uglier too, because when I do something like hit escape, it doesn't necessarily know which modal is open without my either A) running a check or B) keeping the open modal in a variable. I went with A, because B seemed clunky, but I dunno if that was the right call.
