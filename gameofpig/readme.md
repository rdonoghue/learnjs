# Notes for this Project

- Once again, if somethign isn't working, remember to check capitalization
- this time I had to use _getElementById_ instead of _querySelector_, and I need to find out if there are nuances beyond the obvious, but hopefully the video will fill that in.
  - Like, Hey, it doesn't use th .!
- Accidentally tab completed _getAnimations_ - definitely curious what that does
- I keep forgetinng that foreach is a method not a function (is that terminology right?) and it looks like:

```javascript
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c'];

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));
```
