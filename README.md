### Observations

- much easier to sync vscode when both computers are using the same account.
- installed live-server - just need to run 'live-server' in the directory and it opens that index.html, so that's SUPER convenient.
  -stuff puleld out of the css
  align-items: center;

  display: flex;

- Ok, important lesson on for loops, in vs of. **in** will do a count through an array, but **of** will go through the contents of an array (maybe a dict too? Something to test)
